Do you like my profile and want to build your own? It's very simple. GitHub recently added a new feature called **Profile Readmes**. For it to work, do the following:

1. Create a *special* GitHub repository with your username as repository name. My username is `Akash-chowrasia` so my profile readme repository has the name `Akash-chowrasia`.
1. Add a `README.md` to this repository.
1. Put some cool content about yourself (or anything you want) into `README.md`.

And that's about it. The `README.md` of your profile readme repository will be displayed on your profile page.
